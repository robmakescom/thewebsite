                        <h2>The Problem</h2>
                        <p>With the exception of minor compliance updates, the TRC had not been prioritized for a redesign since its launch in 1999. The company's sales team were losing contracts to competitors and the massive account management team dedicated to assisting Plan Sponsors were spending most of their time putting out fires instead of building relationships with their clients.</p>
                        <p>The dashboard especially, being the most visited page, looks outdated; and based on our research, did not focus on the most important elements for users.</p>
                        
                        <h2 class="mt40">Research</h2>
                        <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sanchitgupta87/" target="_blank">Sanchit Gupta</a> and I paired up with the task of creating a long-term strategy to launch a "Next-Gen TRC." We were given eight weeks to: completely understand the space; review documentation, including years of compiled feature requests; and interview users (internally &amp; externally).</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="mt20">Competitive Analysis</h3>
                        <p>Competitors aren't always forthcoming when it comes to sharing their equivalent tools. The proprietary information and sensitive user data creates a unique challenge when it comes to research. Fortunately, a loyal TPA (Third-Party Administrator) was able to help us get access to a few competitor's demo sites and provide walk-throughs. Additionally, I posed as a prospective client to receive product demos for a few players in the emerging space.</p>

				          <h3>The Findings</h3>
				          <p>We worked with tech and delivery leads, business analysts and portfolio managers to draft an enhancement priority, and created <a href="" target="_blank">a formal presentation of our findings</a>. Knowing the audience would be full of C-level executives, Sanchit and I rehearsed our first presentation several times before delivery.</p>
				          <p>The findings were subsequently presented to various business units and all levels of stakeholders, to over 200 MassMutual employees and partners. Our recommendations blessed, we kicked off the creation of a conceptual design.</p>

A/B tests were devised for Account Managers and feedback was fielded from various influential partners across the business.</p>
                    <p class="white">Creating a visual hierarchy, compartmentalizing the data points and displaying clear, concise actions were of high value. Eventually, a direction to continue with a top navigation was chosen, with a progressive disclosure tab-structure used to separate like information.</p>

                        <p>What could the TRC look like two or three years from now? We were asked to create a clickable prototype that represents a possible, <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/blue-sky-thinking" target="_blank"><em>blue sky</em></a> version of the platform. Focusing on our identified priorities, we created scores of pages and new functionalities to help users achieve their goals, including participant data, enhanced reporting features, _____ and a redesigned dashboard.</p>
                        <p>That <a href="https://massmutual.invisionapp.com/share/WNDKDHVYQ" target="_blank">conceptual design</a>, loaded into InvisionApp as a clickable prototype, was presented and shared dozens of times, incorporating feedback from each session when necessary. Eventually, it was handed over to <a href="http://www.jilliannadell.com/" target="_blank">Jillian</a> for <a href="https://massmutual.invisionapp.com/share/ZTFIYK7X64S" target="_blank">visual design</a>.</p>

                        <p>One recurring piece of feedback from our user interviews was that the myriad of information the TRC offered was difficult to traverse, and many expert users were not aware of some functionalities of the tool, though they had been there for decades.</p>
                        <p>As part of our research, we conducted a Card Sorting exercise with users, in person and online using <a href="https://www.optimalworkshop.com/optimalsort" target="_blank">OptimalSort</a>. We transformed the site's pages, components, and features (existing and future) into 74 cards, and asked users to sort them into categories by using a standard script.</p>
                        <p>As we had fewer than 30 participants, using the "Best Merge Method" dendogram, and Similarity Matrix, we were able to propose a recategorized navigation and relabeling of data elements to better help the user identify useful parts of the TRC.</p>

                    	<p>There was push back from product and UX; generating extra steps for the user is not the preferred method, this adds another technical challenge for the dev team, and this is not a requirement for new loans. In the end, the decision stood, but we were able to incorporate iOS and Android native select boxes and toggles.</p>

								<p>Technologically, the app would send over the user's details, then over the first 11 seconds, check every 300MS for a reply. Afterwards, it would check every 5 seconds up to one minute before timing out.</p>
								<p>Initially the product requirements were to generate a determinate progress bar, but not being positive of when the reply would return, the dev team would have to force completion before delivering the user to the decision screen. The Product Owner, certain they were up for the task, asked me to mock up an animation.</p>

                    	<p>After stringing together a clickable prototype on InvisionApp, I generated questions for user testing and worked with the Product Owner and User Researcher to test on UserTesting.com. The questions we were looking to understand:</p>
                    	<ul>
                    		<li>How do people feel about the "edit info" functionality and each one being on separate screens?</li>
                    		<li>Do users understand they need to "Enter Amount…" under "Estimated Gross Annual Revenue" to continue on the app's business verify screen?</li>
                    		<li>Once on the approval screen, do users know there is more than the single offer?</li>
                    		<li>Does a user know where to tap to review details about each offer?</li>
                    		<li>Does a user understand the information in the "Details about this offer" screen?
	                    		<ul>
									<li>What is the Rate?</li>
									<li>How often are payments made?</li>
									<li>How long is the term?</li>
									<li>What will be deposited into their bank account?</li>
	                    		</ul>
                    		</li>
                    		<li>Can the user answer questions about comparing the offers, like, which one has the highest pay back amount? or which one has the lowest interest rate?</li>
                    	</ul>

                    	<p class="mt20">After six user tests, the results showed that all users thought the renewal process itself was easy to complete (one user had issue with the task wording, but still completed the application itself easily). The majority of users bypassed the other offers pursuing the call to action to click the first shown option.</p> 
                    	<p>On the term details page, users with larger phones did not view the loan details box, as it looked like everything was visible. Regarding editing fields, only one user explicitly mentioned them. She mentioned that she did like the way the information was clearly laid out.</p>
                    	<p>The <strong>recommended actions</strong> were to: show all offers by default and have an indication that there is more content below the break on the "Term Details" page. This was done by removing the sticky "Continue" button forcing the user to scroll down and see the table.</p>
                    	
                    	<h4 class="mt60">Rebrand</h4>
                    	<p>While I was designing this new experience, there was a simultaneous rebrand happening across the company, which is why you may see different logos and colors on some of the mockups.</p>
                    	<p>The product team requested this feature and the app launch at the same time as the new public site and rebrand, so I worked with the developers to supply assets, creating new icons and updating content and elements to be on brand. Dozens of new icons were created for iOS and Android.</p>

                    	<p>After four sprints, the design was completed and uploaded to <a href="https://zeplin.io/" target="_blank">Zeplin</a>, where the developers were able to find presentation specs and download SVGs if they needed. You can see the updated app in the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ondeck-capital/id1014118058?mt=8" target="_blank">iTunes store</a> and on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ondeck" target="_blank">Google Play</a>.</p>
